# PhReQ

**Ph**oenix + **Re**act + Graph**Q**L

An experiment in setting up:

* Backend app running Phoenix to host a GraphQL API
* React frontend app with no server-side components

<aside class="notice">
This is not production ready or even semi-serious code; it is purely a learning exercise and should probably not be used for reference.

## Starting the servers

### Backend
`cd backend; mix phx.server`

### Frontend
`cd frontent; yarn start`

Then view at [localhost:3000]
